Wireworld is a cellular automaton which is well suited for simulating logic gates.

Each cell can be in one of four states:

    empty
    conductor
    electron head
    electron tail
    
The simulation proceeds in discrete steps. Each step changes the cells in the following ways:

    empty → empty
    electron head → electron tail
    electron tail → conductor
    conductor → Electron head if one or two neighboring cells are electron heads, else it remains a conductor. 
    A cell neighbors another if it is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent (Moore neighborhood).
    
Run worldwire.py to start it. Requires Python 3.



Conductor cells are yellow, electron heads are blue and electron tails are red.
